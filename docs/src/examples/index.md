# Examples

This examples in this section are designed to be reviewed in order to gradually
build your familiarity with [SBPF](../index#background) program development and
analysis.

You can review the content from each of the following examples without running
any commands yourself, but if you want the full interactive experience you
should complete the [quickstart](../quickstart) first since it will help you
set up your environment to run common commands.

> [!important]
> If you try to interactively run the examples but you haven't first done the
> [quickstart](../quickstart) then you'll probably get confused by tools like
> [the dump script](../quickstart#env-setup).
